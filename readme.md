# Lights pattern

- This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a Python file to generate a circular pattern of lights evenly spread.

- The user selects the radius of the larger and smaller circles, as well as the number of circles and number of lights to be used

- The end pattern can be saved in a PDF file to be used as a template

## Notes
- Make sure you install the environment in the [lights.yml](./lights.yml) file by running the following command in the terminal

> conda create --name environment_name --file environment.yml
